To complete the implementation of the database, you are to provide SQL queries that could be used to create reports demonstrating the correctness, consistency, and completeness of your relational database. You are required to write six queries. You must provide a description of the information being retrieved with each of the SQL queries you create. These descriptions are to be aimed at users of the database (not necessarily someone who is knowledgeable of SQL), thus make them as clear as possible.

Each query must retrieve information from multiple tables (at least three) and should rename columns when necessary so that they are more descriptive than the name of the column in the table (when the column name is not descriptive).

At least two queries must use outer joins appropriately.
1. 
2.


At least three of the queries must aggregate values for groups of rows. 
	One of these must be combined with the use of outer joins and aggregate a column that has some NULLs as a result of the outer joins.

	One of these three queries must also use the HAVING clause appropriately.

	3. 
Three of the queries must demonstrate different aspects of subqueries (e.g. one to find the entity that has the minimum (or maximum) value of a certain property, another to find the entity that satisfies all of a certain criteria -- e.g. using Universal quantifier, etc.). Vary your use of subqueries such that one query can find minimum (or maximum) of something, and the others must be used to meet criteria different from this.

At least one of the queries must use set difference in a non-trivial way. Recall that MySQL does not directly support the set difference operator, so you must do this via a subquery combined with the NOT IN operator or with the use of outer joins.
